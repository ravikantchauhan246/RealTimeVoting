# Real Time Voting


This project involves the development of a real-time voting application using Next.js 14, a popular React framework that enables server-side rendering and static site generation. The application is designed to handle live voting scenarios, such as polls for events, community decisions, or public opinions. To support real-time data updates and ensure high availability and low latency, the application utilizes Upstash, a serverless Redis database.
